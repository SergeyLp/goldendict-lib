# goldendict-lib

This is my fork of GoldenDict ( https://github.com/goldendict/goldendict ).

Original GoldenDict is a monolithic project and doesn't contains a separate library to be used in external programms.

So, all necessary backend goldendict files organized to be used as static library in my other projects.

Depends on  Qt 5.x library, can be compiled with C++11 support.
